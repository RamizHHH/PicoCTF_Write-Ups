# My PicoCTF Write-Ups

This repository contains a variety of solutions to different PicoCTF challenges I have completed.

**Why I created this repository**

- To document my learning process and problem-solving skills in the cybersecurity space.
- To provide clear and comprehensive explanations of how to solve each challenge.
- To showcase my practical skills in solving different cybersecurity questions and problems.
- To help anyone who does not understand how to solve a problem.

## How to navigate

Challenges are organized by their respective categories, at the root level, I only have folders for each category and inside them are the different challenges I have completed and written a write-up on. **Note for every challenge I do not give the entire flag; make sure to go through each challenge and solve it yourself instead of copying and pasting the flag.**
